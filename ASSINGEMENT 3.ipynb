    "\n",
    "ANS-Abstract Super Class. A common superclass for several subclasses. Factor up common behavior. Define the methods they all respond to. Methods that subclasses should implement are declared abstract.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases your superclass might actually have a default implementation for the method that subclasses are supposed to override. In that case, you cannot make the method abstract. You can still make the superclass abstract though, even if it contains no abstract methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Super class being an abstract class creates an overhead for all its sub classes to compulsorily define its abstract methods. I understand that it's very basic but I need to know why do programmers usually make super class as an abstract class, though we can do similar things using a super class as a non abstract class.\n",
    "\n",
    "An abstract superclass is one way to provide re-usable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can extend the abstract class and inherit the code. This is sometimes more convenient than using static methods or object composition to share code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The abstract class can \"fix\" parts of the code (by making it final). This is called the \"template method\" pattern (and this is not possible with an interface, which cannot provide final methods).\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, you can achieve both with a non-abstract superclass as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "An abstract class has the additional benefit that it does not have to provide a complete implementation (that would make sense to instantiate on its own), some parts can be left specified, but unimplemented (the abstract methods)."

    "\n",
    "ANS-Local variables have Function Scope: They can only be accessed from within the function. Since local variables are only recognized inside their functions, variables with the same name can be used in different functions. Local variables are created when a function starts, and deleted when the function is completed.\n",
    "\n",
    "A variable's scope is the range of the script where it is visible. Variables have either global or local scope. A global variable exists only once in a script, and is visible in every function. A local variable, however, has a limited scope: it exists only within the block that it is declared in.\n",
