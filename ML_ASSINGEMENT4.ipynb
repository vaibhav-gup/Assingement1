    "ANS-Step 1: Data Acquisition\n",
    "The first step in the machine learning process is to get the data. This will depend on the type of data you are gathering and the source of data. This can be either static data from an existing database or real-time data from an IoT system or data from other repositories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2: Data Cleaning\n",
    "All real-world data is often unorganized, redundant, or has missing elements. In order to feed data into the machine learning model, we need to first clean, prepare and manipulate the data. This is the most crucial step in the machine learning workflow and takes up the most time as well. Having clean data means that you can get a more accurate model down the road.\n",

    "\n",
    "Step 4: Model Testing\n",
    "After the model is trained, we need to test and validate it for further processing. By using the testing dataset obtained from Step 3, we can check the accuracy of the model. If the results are not satisfactory, the model should be further improved. The model is trained and improved over and over again until the results are satisfactory. \n",
    "\n",
    "Step 5: Deployment\n",
    "Once the model is trained, deploy and pipeline it to production for application consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "The machine learning process that we have outlined here is a fairly standard process. As you go through this process on your own with your own problems, you will start to discover a few more machine learning steps that might work for you. For example, as you clean your data, you may find better questions to ask or feed the model. As you tune your model, you may realize you need more data, and so on. The important part is to keep iterating until you find a model that fits your project the most."

Feature selection selects and excludes given features without changing them, while dimensionality reduction transforms features into a lower dimension12. Feature selection identifies the features that best represent the relationship amongst all in the feature space as well as the target that the model will try to predict23. Feature selection yields a subset of features from the original set of features, which are the best representatives of the data, while dimensionality reduction is generic and only depends on the data and not on what you plan to do with it3."
