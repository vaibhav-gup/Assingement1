A Metaclass defines the behavior of the Class itself.A metaclass in Python is a class of a class that defines how a class behaves. A class is itself an instance of a metaclass. \n",

In a nutshell, we can say metaprogramming is the code that manipulates code. In this article, we are going to discuss Metaclasses, why and when we should use them, and what are the alternatives. This is a fairly advance Python topic and the following prerequisite is expected â€“\n",

    "ANS-Decorators can be used to manage both instances and classes, and they intersect with metaclasses in the second of these roles. However, this really addresses only one operational mode of metaclasses. As we'll see, decorators correspond to metaclass__init_methods in this role, but metaclasses have additional customization hooks."
