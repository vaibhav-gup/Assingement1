    "Q1. What is the relationship between classes and modules?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS-Classes in python are templates for creating objects. They contain variables and functions which define the class objects. At the same time, modules are python programs that can be imported into another python program. Importing a module enables the usage of the module’s functions and variables into another program.\n",

    "EXAMPLE\n",
    "# A simple module, calc.py\n",
    "def add(x, y):\n",
    "\treturn (x+y)\n",
    "\n",
    "def subtract(x, y):\n",

    "\n",
    "ANS-A class is a user-defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. Classes provide a means of bundling data and functionality together. Creating a new class creates a new type of object, allowing new instances of that type to be made. Each class instance can have attributes attached to it for maintaining its state. Class instances can also have methods (defined by its class) for modifying its state.\n",
    "\n",
    "An instance method can access and even modify the value of attributes of an instance. It has one default parameter:-\n",

For example operator + is used to add two integers as well as join two strings and merge two lists. It is achievable because ‘+’ operator is overloaded by int class and str class.

    "\n",
    "Ans: The two most important concepts to grasp in order to comprehend Python OOP code are classes and objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "A class in Python is a template or blueprint for creating objects. It defines the attributes and methods that objects of that class will have, and provides a way to initialize those attributes and access and modify them. An object is an instance of a class. It contains the specific data and behavior that are defined by the class, and it can be used to perform actions and manipulate data using the methods of the class. Understanding these two concepts is essential for comprehending Python OOP code, as most Python OOP code is organized into classes and objects. Once you understand how classes and objects work in Python, you will be able to understand how the code uses them to define data and behavior, and how to create and use objects of those classes in your own code."
