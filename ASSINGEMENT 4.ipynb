    "ANS-In Python, you can use the \"__iter__()\" and \"__next__()\" operator overloading methods in your classes to support iteration. The \"__iter__()\" method returns the iterator object and is implicitly called at the start of loops. The \"__next__()\" method returns the next value from the iterator. When there are no more items to return, it should raise StopIteration exception"

    "ANS-The two operator overloading methods __str__() and __repr__() manage printing in Python. The __str__() method is used to define the string representation of an object. It is called by the str() built-in function and by the print statement to compute the “informal” or nicely printable string representation of an object. The __repr__() method is used to define the string representation of an object. It is called by the repr() built-in function and by the interactive interpreter to compute the “official” string representation of an objec"

The __getitem__() method is called when an object is accessed using the square bracket notation. It takes one argument, which is either an integer index or a slice object. If the argument is an integer index, the method should return the corresponding item. If the argument is a slice object, the method should return a new object that represents the slice"

    "\n",
    "ANS-Operator overloading is appropriate when you want to define custom behaviors for operators in Python. In Python, most operators such as +, -, *, /, etc., are mapped to special methods or “dunder” methods that can be defined in a class to customize the behavior of the operator when applied to instances of that class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Operator overloading is mostly useful when you’re making a new class that falls into an existing “Abstract Base Class” (ABC) – indeed, many of the ABCs in standard library module collections rely on the presence of certain special methods (and special methods, one with names starting and ending with double underscores AKA “dunders”, are exactly the way you perform operator overloading in Python).\n",
    "\n",
    "In some ways, though, overloading in Python is still as “broken” as in C++. Programmers should restrain the desire to “re-use” an operator for unrelated purposes."
