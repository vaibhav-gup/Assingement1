The average height is found to be roughly 175 cm (5' 9\"), counting both males and females. . Meanwhile, taller and shorter people exist, but with decreasing frequency in the population. According to the empirical rule, 99.7% of all people will fall with +/- three standard deviations of the mean, or between 154 cm (5' 0\") and 196 cm (6' 5\"). Those taller and shorter than this would be quite rare (just 0.15% of the population each).\n"
