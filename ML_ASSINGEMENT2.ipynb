    "\n",
    "ANS-In reinforcement learning, the learner is a decision-making agent that takes actions in an environment and receives reward (or penalty) for its actions in trying to solve a problem. After a set of trial-and-error runs, it should learn the best policy, which is the sequence of actions that maximize the total reward1. The reward function is used to define a goal in a reinforcement learning problem. It provides a numerical score based on the state of the environment2. The value of a state is the total amount of reward an agent can expect to accumulate over the future, starting from that state2. The agent is rewarded for correct moves and punished for the wrong ones. In doing so, the agent tries to minimize wrong moves and maximize the right ones3.\n"

It is used to reduce the complexity of data and make it easier to understand. One example of abstraction in machine learning is the use of decision trees. Decision trees are used to represent complex data in a simplified form by breaking down the data into smaller parts and then representing each part as a node on the tree. Each node represents a decision that needs to be made based on the data. The tree is then used to make predictions about new data based on the decisions made at each node1."

This method assigns positive values to the desired actions to encourage the agent and negative values to undesired behaviors. This programs the agent to seek long-term and maximum overall reward to achieve an optimal solution.\n",
